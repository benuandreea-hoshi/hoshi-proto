    <h1>Commonwealth of People</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      A practical governance frame for real estate: set a public ecological floor, price carbon with a shared rate, and turn alarms into enforceable actions you can audit.

  <h2>Why this exists: WGA</h2>
  <p><b>WGA (“war of all against all”):</b> when many actors share the same critical systems (carbon budget, power grids, breathable air) but no one has standing to set and enforce minimums, everyone optimises locally and risk lives in the gaps. Cooperation frays; long-horizon projects stall. Hobbes’ cure was a <i>commonwealth</i>: people covenant to an authority that can set common rules so peace and promise-keeping are possible. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</p>

  <p>Translated to buildings: owners, tenants, lenders, facilities teams and vendors each “do their bit” (save a bill here, report an ESG metric there), but nobody guarantees the shared floor that keeps the whole system safe and investable. That’s the gap the Commonwealth frame closes. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</p>

  <h2>The answer: a shared floor + four instruments</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Commonwealth Cost of Carbon (CCC).</b>
      A public carbon price—owned by the commonwealth, not by a firm—referenced in underwriting, budgeting and leases. It disciplines decisions with a non-optional ecological price floor. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
      <div class="example">
        <b>Example.</b> A heat-pump retrofit that barely clears payback at today’s tariffs becomes NPV-positive once you value avoided emissions at the CCC; the decision stops depending on fuel-price luck. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Assured ecological ledger.</b>
      Claims (baselines, methods, factors, licenses) are recorded and versioned, so numbers are inspectable rather than asserted. That turns promises into assets you can rely on. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Public alarms & rulings.</b>
      Breaches trigger alarms with shared priority (P1–P4). Rulings state “what good looks like” and how success is verified; they’re treated as enforceable promise-templates, not tips. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Executive function (fairness).</b>
      Rulings are peer-reviewed and justified in clear terms (baseline, method, factors) with in-situ commissioning and due-process, so enforcement is legitimate, not capricious. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>How it shows up in property</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Leases.</b> Add a clause: “Operating plans and capex appraisal will apply the Commonwealth Cost of Carbon at the prevailing public rate.” Tenants, owners, and auditors now share the same price floor. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}</li>
    <li><b>Underwriting.</b> Model retrofit NPV/IRR with CCC, not only tariff savings; compare actions by ROI at a portfolio scale.</li>
    <li><b>Operations.</b> Alarms (“P2 Electricity Overrun 12-month”) map to rulings (playbooks) with acceptance criteria and M&amp;V method; results are logged in the ledger. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Three quick use-cases</h2>
  <div class="cards">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Gas-heavy office</h3>
      <p>P2 overrun triggers an action: “LED + schedule + heat-pump pre-study.” The plan shows CapEx, savings, <b>NPV</b> at CCC, β/sensitivity to prices, comfort risk, and tCO₂e; acceptance = “≥15% reduction vs baseline; M&amp;V by bills (12m) with weather normalization.” :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Tenant fit-out</h3>
      <p>Lease addendum binds both parties to the CCC and to the rulings library for overheating and plug-load management. Disputes escalate through the executive function; the ledger keeps versions and licenses. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Lender covenant</h3>
      <p>Green-capex facility references the ledger for method/factor versions and uses alarm priorities to trigger remedial plans rather than generic default clauses. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Key terms (1-minute refresher)</h2>
  <dl class="gloss">
    <dt>WGA</dt>
    <dd>“War of all against all.” Hobbes’ diagnosis: without a coordinating authority over shared systems, trust collapses and long-term cooperation fails. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}</dd>
    <dt>CCC</dt>
    <dd>Commonwealth Cost of Carbon: a public carbon price floor used in budgets, leases and appraisal. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}</dd>
    <dt>Assured ledger</dt>
    <dd>Governed record of promises with baseline, method, factors, licenses and versioning. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}</dd>
    <dt>Alarms & rulings</dt>
    <dd>Shared priorities + reviewed playbooks that turn breaches into testable actions with M&amp;V and acceptance criteria. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}</dd>
    <dt>Executive function</dt>
    <dd>Peer-review + explainability + escalation, so enforcement has legitimacy and due-process. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Why now</h2>
  <p>Rates are higher; energy is noisy; policy is tightening; tenants expect comfort and proof. The Commonwealth frame gives portfolios a shared floor, a public carbon rate, fair enforcement, and an audit-ready record—so choices become decision-grade capital signals. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}</p>
